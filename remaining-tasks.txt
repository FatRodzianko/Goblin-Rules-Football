### Other "Goblin Sports" games to add:
- Golf
- - - Look to recreate something like Golf Story / Mario Golf for GBA
- - - "OGgolf" looks like basically what I am trying to make...
- - - - - - https://store.steampowered.com/app/1608820/OGgolf/
- - - "Cursed To Golf" may be a better model for this. Basically a 2d side scroller with golf mechanics. Adds more of a platforming element. Also seems easier. Also, seems like it would be better suited for a multiplayer arcade thing where you can hit power ups with your ball and attack other players or whatever
- - - - - - putting might be challenging. No "slopes", but maybe just have a flat platform with <<< or >>> to indicate if it slopes there or something?
- Baseball
- - - Something like "Baseball Stars 2"
- - - Super Baseball 2020
- - - Ken Griffey, Jr. Presents Major League Baseball
- - - RBI Baseball 93
- - - - - - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg8KsCSE5k4
- croquet?
- - - like Kirby's Dream Course
- Bowling
- - - Championship Bowling for NES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txV21zS2PBA
- Basketball:
- - - Tecmo Basketball: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZYcTUBTpsg
- - - obviously nba jam
- - - barklet shut up and jam https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlUjvlYLjIA
- - - - - - when players go for big jams they can have miny fights/kicks/punches and stuff?
- Dodgeball
- - - Super Dodgeball https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=736nU3J_j9s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFb8GaCoEyQ
- - - SNES version? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np7-xrlYhLg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzlBeHzSISU
- - - these are kind of like fighting games but with dodgeball???
- Soccer:
- - - Nintendo world cup https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPKoHVO5g3o

### Remaining tasks
(x) Punch animations while goblins are running
- - - grenadier completed!
- - - skirmisher completed!
- - - Berserker completed!
(x) Have camera follow selected goblin. Move the camera to the side when the player gets near the edge?
- - - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jTY11Am0Ig&t=30s
- - - https://answers.unity.com/questions/266454/top-down-2d-gamehow-to-make-the-camera-move-on-hit.html
- - - have camera follow football if the football is thrown?
- - - it works?

(x) If the ball is not in the player's view, have some sort of flag/marker display where the ball is on the side
- - - change the ball marker if it is held by an opponent?
(x) maybe the same as above for the Q/E goblins?
- - - change this so it's something like a UI canvas or the camera only spawning something in the UI. Not on the goblin/football itself. 
- - - Hopefully that gets rid of the jitteR?
- - - Camera will have script to enable/disable the ball marker and Q/E markers
- - - Football and Goblins will track when they are off the screen. When they are, call function in Camera script to enable the marker
- - - - - - when they are on screen, call function to disable marker
- - - - - - send Y axis value to camera function to update that. Never changed the x value? Hopefully that gets rid of the jitter
- kicking a football down field
- - (x) animate the kicking motion?
- - - calculate how far the football goes?
- - (x) draw shadow on ground that follows the football's path? (have football go off screen until it lands?)
- - - - - - use "linear interpolation" to calculate the point along the line from where football started to football destination?
- - - - - - apparently Vector3.Lerp can do this? https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.Lerp.html second example with using a start time, time elapsed with time.time, and "speed" to calculate distance covered along the line? (kickCount is already tracking distance covered in a lerp function?)
- - - - - - have a function that "moves" the shadow to the point calculate from the vector3 calculating the X distance of the arc? (Vector3 m2 = Vector3.Lerp(KickedBallPoints[1], KickedBallPoints[2], kickCount);)
- - (x) mark on the field where the football will land with an X or something (maybe it's really big and gets smaller as the football is closer to landing
- - (x) figure out how to make the football "bonuce" off the ground if it isn't caught?
- - (x) have a "kick meter" that moves back and forth. Player holds down key to kick, meter appears, when player releases the key the value of the meter is passed to the kick function to determine the distance of the kick

- - - - - - https://pavcreations.com/archery-combat-mechanic-in-2d-pixel-perfect-unity-game/
- - - When there are "field goals" instead of a power bar coming up, a "accuracy bar" will come up
- - - - - - when goblin is within a certain range of the endzone
- - - - - - bar moves back and forth until player releases button. Has to end with the button in between two values, represented by some sort of bar or different color?
(x) make it so you can't pass forward - only if the other goblins are "behind" or even with you
- - - have the Q/E markers turn red or something when they can't be passed to
- - - based on X value of the goblin with the ball
- - - Make the Q/E markers the grey/red color if you can't pass to them
- Game UI stuff for things like score, time remaining, powerups?
- - - "pixel perfect fonts" https://pavcreations.com/pixel-perfect-fonts-in-unity-the-practical-guide/
- - - Two cameras, one for UI and one for the game? https://pavcreations.com/pixel-perfect-graphics-in-unity-the-practical-guide/

- - - another pixelperfect font tutorial: https://medium.com/@dan.liberatore/pixel-perfect-text-and-ui-in-unity-2021-56d60ba9370f
- - - - - - font from that tutorial: https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/908795/pixel_unicode
- For tracking possession in UI: When the football is isHeld, check what team that goblin is, update possession UI
- - - When the ball is thrown, don't update possession right away. Wait until isThrown is false. If it is false and isHeld is false, remove all possession UI


(x) Create a "GameplayManager" type thing that starts off the process of spawning goblin teams, football, and setting the camera stuff?
(x) Have goblins slowed down when they get punched for a second?
(x) Wait for all players to load a scene before spawning the new game player objects?
- - - When the server changes the scene, have the following happen?
- - - Client spawns some sort of UI that covers the screen - in OnClientChangeScene?
- - - - - - make sure UI object is DontDestroyOnLoad?
- - - Then, in OnClientSceneChanged, after the scene has changed, remove the UI that blocks the screen?
(x) - - When a player is spawned/ finished loading the scene, have the gameplay object send a command to the server to say they are down loading.
- - - when all players are loaded, spawn the goblins?

### Gameplay "phases" once the game starts
(x) Coin Flip to determine who will receive/kick
- - - Greys to be considered the "away" team?
- - (x) Animate a coin being flipped
- - (x) Have player choose heads / tails. Two options with arrow on top/below player switches between? look at code from choose commander in cardconquest
- - - Some way of indicating to player they they are either the green or grey team in the UI?
- - - Maybe draw a referee goblin? They stand between the two spawned teams and flip the coin?
- - - "insert" image or picture-in-picture image of the coin flipping and landing on ground - text comes up saying heads or tails?
- - (x) after coin toss, the "winning" player decides to kick or receive?
- - (x) make it so the camera doesn't follow the goblin yet during coin selection?
- Kickoff phase
- - (x) Move kicking and receiving teams to their starting positions - moved by the server
- - - - - - Probably have some "zoomed out" view of the field shown that is a brief animation of the teams moving to their kickoff locations. More of a long term goal. Not really needed right now? This is just meant as a "break" or transition between the action of the coin flip and kick after attempts to let the player know a kickoff is about to happen
- - - - - (x) issue with grey kicking team not picking up ball because server thinks distance between goblin and ball is too great
- - (x) enable Q/E switching for the receiving team? Not needed for the kicking team?
- - - - - (x) "EnableQESwitchingControls" is being called twice
- - (x) Kicking team chooses power/direction of kick?
- - - Receiving team has Goblins lined up in triangle formation? Berserker/grenadier near front and skirmisher near the end zone
- - - Big shadow covers where ball will land. Gets smaller as the ball moves closer to landing zone, until it makes the target
- - - Maybe have possibility of onside kick of ball goes 10 yards/whatever specified distance
- - (x) Finishing "drawing" the whole field
- - (x) Create field goal posts in endzone?
- Regular "Game" phase
- - - goblins running around. Passing. Punching each other. Can collect and user power ups that spawn. Also obstacles randomly spawn in front of ball carrier?
- - (x) timer goes down during this phase - start when ball is kicked. Server controlled.
- - (x) create "bounds" of the field with colliders - along sidelines and endzones
- - - - - - +-44.5 for max football x value
- - (x) make it so goblins and the football can't go past the endzones
- - (x) remove goal posts from the tilemap and just add them as objects in the game so they render correctly. also add the colliders to the posts so players can't run through them
- - (x) detect when players enter an endzone. If they have the ball and dive, detect touchdown
- - (x) stop timer when touchdown is scored
- - (x) add 5 points to team score when touchdown scored
- - (x) save Y value of football/goblin when touchdown happens. Used for the point after phase
- - - generate random powerups that spawn throughout the field. Players can pick them up
- - - have random "events" that spawn obstacles in front of the player with the ball that they have to dodge - holes, fallen trees, broken glass bottles?
- "Touchdown" phase
- - - goblin must touch ball down in endzone to score. Use the roll button to touchdown
- - - if goblin doesn't touchdown, opposing team can try and punch the ball free
- - - save Y value of where ball was touched down for next phase
- - - touchdown worth 5 points
- Point after phase
- - (x) team that scored touchdown must kick a ball through uprights for extra 2 points
- - (x) ball must be kicked from same Y axis value as where ball was touched down
- - (x) scoring team can move ball back as far as they want for best "angle"
- - - - - (x) calculate the angle as the player moves back/forward - indicate how much "easier" the kick is based on angle
- - - - - (x) The two bars on the "accuracy" meter will move further apart for easier kick, closer together for harder kicks
- - - - - (x) Have the kicking player "submit" the distance to kick from with enter?
- - (x) goblin that touched the ball down is the one who kicks it. Goblins will have kicking stats that affect what angles they can kick from and their kicking power/accuracy
- - - - - - indicate to player in some way the max distance the goblin can kick, have some sort of red line drawn for max distance?
- - (x) when the scoring team is kicking, an accuracy "meter" pops up. A bar moves back and forth real fast. Player must stop the bar between two markers. This is done twice. First for power, then accuracy
- - (x) while the scoring player is trying to kick with the meters, defending player can have a goblin run toward the kicker. If the defending goblin makes it to the kicker before the kick is off, the kick is blocked
- - - timer in UI blocks accuracy bar when player scores at bottom of the endzone - make it so goblins always display over UI or something?
- - - - - - same issue when scoring up top - powerup UI can block goblin heads and stuff
- - - - - - set the y dead zone on the virtual camera to 0.525? Will require adding more tiles to the top and bottom to fill out the screen
- - - ISSUES AFTER KICK IS GOOD/BAD
- - - - - (x) the "kick off angle" value doesn't get updated on the new kick off. same with the kick power for the kickoff
- - - - - (x) When a goblin scores another touchdown, their "is kick after position set" is set to true, so they can't move
- - - - - (x) the previous scoring goblin still has their "is kick after goblin" value set to true
- Back to kick off phase. Scoring team kicks
- Xtra Time
- - (x) When the timer gets to 0, start "Xtra Time"
- - (x) The game will keep going until the ball touches the ground/a touchdown is scored
- - - - - (x) if the ball is fumbled and not caught in the air, thrown and lands ont he ground, kicked and land on ground, score a touchdown
- - - Allowed to pass/kick/whatever normal gameplay controls
- - (x) If a touchdown is scored, check the final score
- - - - - (x) if the touchdown scorer has the lead, no kick after is required
- - - - - (x) if they are down by 2 or less, they get to attempt the kick after
- - - if the winning team takes a dive/roll with the ball, that should end the game?
- - - - - - nah, they just have to kick it away?
- Powerups
- - (x) During gameplay and xtra-time, powerups spawn randomly on the field
- - - if a player controlled goblin runs into one, they "pickup" the powerup
- - - powerups get added to player's powerup inventory, max of 4 powerups
- - (x) check if spawned powerups are overlapping - move the newly spawned one if they are? move it a random x/y amount
- - x When a player heals a knocked out player, it should immediately revive them? Right now, they still wait and when they aren't knocked out, their health is at 25%, wasting the heal
- - - After a touchdown, delete all powerups that are on the field to start over?
- - - - - - or make it so the kicking goblin can't pick it up? only real issue is that the player picks up stuff when they are being moved on the server. Maybe disable their colliders or something in the functions that reposition them?
- - x "animate" the powerups by having them move up and down slowly
- - x add a "shadow" under the powerups
- - x have a visual effect on the goblin using a powerup. Hearts rise from heal, swords from attack, shields from defense, etc.?
- - - instead of having player powerups stored as a list, store as an array. remove the array [index] when power up is used. Allow for blank/null powerups in the 1/2/3/4
- - - - - - right now, if a player has 4 powerups and uses #2, that causes 3 and 4 to move down to 2 and 3, respectively. Can make it confusing for the player
- - - - - - instead, when #2 is used in this scenario, it should just be a blank/empty power up and 3/4 stay where they are?

- "Random Events"
- - - random things should happen during the game, especially around the ball handler
- - x spawn obstacles like logs, broken glass (???), cracks in the ground
- - - - - x if the player doesn't dodge/roll over them, the player is knocked out
- - x for the "crack in the ground" event, maybe have skeleton hands reach out? Like a chasm to hell is opening up?
- - - have something that "runs" across the screen, north/south up/down and vice versa, that players have to dodge. Make it either a streaker with pixelated nudity or an animal like a donkey/giant rat?

### Normal Power Up Ideas
x Heal (full heal maybe?)
x Increase Attack Damage (1.5x? 2x?) for 2 seconds
x Increase "Defense" - Halve damage taken for 2 seconds
x Increase speed of your selected goblin for 2 seconds?
- Prevent tripping? maybe that should be a blue shell?
x banana peel. Throw a banana out in front of you if you don't have ball, behind if you do. Causes anyone who runs into it to trip
- glass bottle to throw
- - - have it so bananas cause goblins to trip if they touch them on the ground. Bottles knock them out if you hit them during the throw?
- - - maybe only have the bottle do like 50 damage. Instant KO seems harsh?
- - - Glass bottle shatter animation?

### Blue Shell Ideas
x Lightning strike - immediately knock out the opposing player with the ball (maybe make it so you can lightning yourself as well for an achievement?)
- Decrease speed of all opposing player goblins for 2-3 seconds?
- Invincibility - like a mario star. Your goblin flashes for a short time. Instantly knocks out any opposing goblin they touch

- - - Most important thing here appears to be the "GetAvoidDirection" function
- - - Find all units around you. Get their direction from you

### Issues?
x if a goblin is knocked out while punching, the isPunching variable gets stuck at true. This prevents player from doing things like picking up a football or performing other actions like diving, sliding, kicking, etc.
- - x When a goblin gets knocked out, will need to make sure that isPunching, isDiving, isSliding, isKicking, etc. are set to false?
x When you dive while blocking, your speed resets back to the slower blocking speed. Need to reset the blocking modifier?
- field is too short now... make it 100 yards instead of the 80. Will need to update the x min/max values through out D:
x Thrown objects look "weird", especially from the client. Maybe make it so they use velocity/momentum/force from the character?
- - - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xMhkK6GTXA - throwing objects
- - - attach rigid bodies and move with rigidbody.moveposition?
- - - tenatively going to say this is fixed? Or at least good enough
- UI Issues
- - x top ui blocks Q/E markers
- - x bottom UI blocks accuracy and power meters during kick after attempts, if player is kicking from very bottom of screen
- Now that goblins move with AI, the kinematic/dynamic rigidbodies may not "work"
- - - when not selected, they are kinematic and can pass through each other and the sidelines
- - x when they are all dynamic, they push each other around and stuff? is that bad now? maybe start allowing for that?
- When a player scores a touchdown but is then knocked out and loses the football, the ball stays on the ground during the kick-after
- - - add the following checks???
- - x check to see if the goblin to kick is knocked out. If they are, make them not-knocked out
- - x check to see if the football is not held, or held by the wrong goblin. If so, move the goblin to the kick off goblin
- - x maybe add a new phase called "touchdown-transition" or something that disables goblin AI movement and also you can't pick up a football during it?
- - - This happened again, but I have no idea how...
- - - Solution idea:
- - - at the start of every kickoff, have the server set a "doneRepositioningForKickAfter" value to false
- - - at the start of kick-after-attempt, every player has to move their goblins
- - - when the goblin has been moved, they will call a command to set "doneRepositioningForKickAfter" to true
- - - the server checks to see if all 6 have had their doneRepositioningForKickAfter value set to true. When they do, wait 0.2 seconds or something and move the football to the kick after kicker
- - - - - - the wait is to account for any sync issues of goblins from the client still moving on the server after doneRepositioningForKickAfter was set to true
- - - - - - it will only need to move the football if the kicker doesn't have it already
x the "off ball" goblins on your team move around too quickly
- - - try to make it so once they have a Y position, they don't change it and only change their X position forward
- - - they will only change their Y if an enemy goblin is between them and the player? Or just change it after a few seconds/one second?
x Should probably add another "State" for the AI where they check to see if an enemy goblin is nearby. If they do, they chase that goblin and attack them?
x Diving no longer works any more... maybe have the rigidbody switch between dynamic and kinematic when they dive?
- - x because I changed the goblins to be on the "goblin-player" layer. The diving footbox was colliding with goblin-player. Changed physics settings so diving footbox no longer colliders with goblin-player
- Gamepad controls:
- - x if you hold the right stick in one position to use a powerup too long, the game freaks out and messes up the powerup usage
- - - - - - afterward, you can no longer use the right stick for the power up
- - - - - - when you use the number on keyboard, or the d-pad, the powerup is called twice: once for the press, the second for the release
- - - - - - easies to trigger this bug with the first power up (right stick to the left), but can be done with others
- - - - - - error message: unity only pass-through actions should be left in performed state by default interaction
- - - - - - suggested fix from a forum: "Fixed by changing some actions shared between the controller and keyboard from "Button" to "Pass Through" type action. "
- - x set the UI/Submit in the event handler to the right analog stick press - that will find the local gameplayer and tell them which button to submit?
- - x maybe on select/deselect, check for localgameplayer and then update the local gameplayer's powerupselect index?
- - x video on UI selection with gamepad https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn804Wgr3KE
x Possible to deal a lot of damage to a goblin and quick knock them out?
- - x I think this is fixed? Added some logic so the same punch box collider wont set off the damage goblin script if it happens more than once at the same time?
- Have some ramp up/down on the speed for sliding and diving
- - - slide will be slower for first ~0.5 seconds, then get faster
- - - opposite for the dive: faster at first then slow down the last 0.5s?
x Have gameplay manager update the possession footballs when the ball is held and not held?
- Game crashed when the server throw a bottle at the client. Not sure what caused the issue?
- Don't change possession icons when the ball is thrown
- - - make sure that isThrown is always set by the server first
- - - if the ball is not held but is thrown, don't change possession. When isThrown is set to false, have client check if the ball is held and then change possession arrow
- - x works on server but due to syncing on isHeld and isThrown on the client, the client doesn't update correctly. Might as well just have the possession arrow change?
x goblins can now dive through goal posts since they are on the pathfinding obstacles layer. Maybe add empty game objects with the same size colliders, on a different layer like sidelines(???) to make sure they can't dive through but that the AI will still navigate around?
x punch box for the berserker is way to big. Make it so it is smaller and follows his club?
x Make the diving hurtbox smaller for all goblins? 
- - - right now it is huge so it fits all of the animation frames without moving
- - - have the dive box "follow" the goblin and adjust its size depending on the frames
- - - will need to remember to "flip" the diving hurtbox when the goblin changes direction?
- - - - - - This is already done to other colliders in the RpcFlipRenderer function. Just add the diving hurtbox to that?
- when the AI slides, they can change direction? They should be stuck moving in the one direction they slide toward
- - - maybe make it so the AI checks stop/don't happen when isSliding is true?
- Goblins aren't avoid obstacles very well... Maybe set them and goblins on the same layer for the avoidance stuff?
- - - or flip the logic. The goblins are on the layer that uses the vectors to avoid. The obstacles are on the layer where they scan to avoid?
- AI is still having problems picking up football on the ground? Really not sure what is causing that...
x change the kick after repositioning buttons for gamepad to rb/lb instead of the analog sticks?
- because I made the footboxes shorter, goblins now can get "higher" than the goalposts and render behind them
- - - lower the pivot point of the goalpost sprite by a small amount or make the footboxes bigger?
- - - also looks like the collider on the upper goal post is too high up. Move it down 1 pixel at least?
x when a goblin punches while running over football, and then stops still over the football, they have to run back and forth before being able to pick up the football
- - x when isPunching is done, have the goblin's body collider toggle on and off?
- - x appears to have worked. also, making this is what was causing AIs from not being able to pick up the ball? Hopefully...
x For kick off, make sure goblin is facing correct direction? Green goblin at least was facing wrong direction once
- - - also, make sure to center the camera for the kick off?
- - - issues appear to mostly be after halftime???
x for 3v3 game, when player is auto switched, the goblin dropdown doesn't update
- - x keeps same dropdown from their old team?
- - x it looks like it is the player who chose had wantsToSwitch set first that has the issue (the first player to switch). The second player to switch gets the right list
x need to change ready status to unready when player switches teams or clicks on change goblin?
- areAllGoblinsLoaded failed to set to true once in a 3v3 game. It was after I did a lot of team switching and players quitting the lobby and then rejoining
- - - ReportGoblinSpawnedForPlayer in NetworkManagerGRF is probably what needs to be troubleshot?
x If you start a singleplayer game, quit, and then host a game, the client doesn't update ready status and can't spawn goblins?
- - x it was because the escape menu in singleplayer set timeScale to 0
- - x fixed by having TitleScreenManager set timeScale to 1.0f in the Start function


### Bottle Throwing event
- Server will spawn the "event-broken-bottle-1" object
- object will start with box collider off and spriterenderer set to "None"
- Thrown bottles will be a prefab attached to the broken glass object
- script starts the bottle throwing - broke glass object spawns bottles with a start and end point for the throw
- - - start point Y position will change to be above or below screen depending on where the broken glass is
- when bottle hits end point, broken glass object turns on collider and sprite renderer

### Random Obstacle Spawner
- Spawn between 4-8 obstacles on the map - the stones and logs that will trip goblins if they run into them
- have designated locations that can't be spawned on - Middle of the field, where the goblins stand during the coin toss, where goblins line up on kickoffs
- - - create an array of Vector3/2's of the points they can't spawn near
- - - have the ObstacleManager spawn the obstacle at a random location within the bounds of the field
- - - when the object is spawned, have the object check if it is on a "bad" spot. If so, move it some specified amount
- - - have the obstacle manager keep track of where the obstacles are. Make sure they aren't too close to one another. If they are, choose a new spot
- Have some sort of way for the football to check if it lands on an obstacles
- - x only when the football is not isKicked or isThrown
- - x have the football do a bounce/fumble in a random direction away from the obstacle?
- - x check the X value of the football and the trip object. If the football's X is greater, bounce to the right. Less, bounce left. Same, choose random direction to bounce?
- Two kinds of obstacles
- - - tripping obstacles - things like rocks and logs where if a player runs into them, they trip
- - - "slow down" obstacles - things like puddles or "shrubs?"/bushes that when a goblin runs into them, slows them by like 30% or something?
x Generate Obstacles
x Place Obstacles
x Verify Obstacle Position


### Possession tracker?
x Under the possession footballs, track how long each player/team has "possessed" the ball
x possession meter rises as they hold onto the ball. Slowly drops if the other team has the ball. Nothing happens if nobody has the ball?
- Effects of increased possession:
- - - goblins move a little faster - specifically when they are carrying the ball. The "ballCarrySpeedModifier" will actually increase instead of decrease?
- - - goblins will have increased max health when carrying the ball? Or maybe take less damage when carrying the ball?
- - - the goal is really just to help break deadlocks of no one being quite able to score. If you can at least hold onto the ball longer than your opponent, you will get an advantage
x Possession meters and their effects will reset after a touchdown is scored
- Have something for when a player is down by a lot. Maybe have their possession meter increase at a faster rate? Start the post-touchdown gameplay with 25% of their possession meter already filled?

### AI tasks
- Make it so goblins will try and "find" someone to attack
- - - check to see if any goblins are close enough to them to attack. If there are, select one as a target
- - - move toward the target and punch when close enough
- - - if the target moves too far away, find a new one/do something else like move toward the ball
- - - stop targetting once target goblin is knocked out - move onto next task or find new target
- For the "off ball" goblins when your team has the ball
- - x don't make it so they are constantly changing their positions once they reach one. Have them keep their "y value" and just modify the X forward/whatever
- - x don't want them jumping back and forther between points. Maybe check to see if an enemy is "between" them somehow?
- Watch the path finding videos and probably try and implement them as a separate script for goblins?
- - - hoping this will help them avoid "trippable" objects like the broken glass, bananas, and later rocks/logs
- - - also maybe have them try and avoid enemy goblins somewhat? Except for the ball carrier?
- - - at minimum, needs to find path around teammates so the goblins don't just push each other around trying to get to points
- Goblins can be "blocked" from their target if opposing goblins "pin" them to the walls sort of
- - - maybe track "last position" and if it hasn't changed for a second, start punching or something?
- - - then make it so a knocked out goblin can't block you?
- - - or have the goblin dive through the blockage? Diving should remove the collider and allow them to pass through
- - - need to rethink how I am doing this. Currently results in just kind of random diving. Maybe instead make it based on colliders? If a non-selected goblin runs into a goblin that isn't their target, dive?

### some ai logic?
- Check what goblins on your team are targetting who
- If a goblin is targetting the ball carrier, select a different goblin to target
- if your goblin target is knocked out, target a different goblin?

### New controls
# keyboard
- change it so only arrow keys move - WASD will no longer move
- move attack/block off of the mouse and onto a/d?

### UI/Gamepad stuff
x Add a "ball" marker that goes over the head of the goblin with the ball and the football when it is not held?
x Add "Rb" and "Lb" markers to replace the Q/E markers if the player is using a gamepad
- Start creating gamepad alternative markers (like the a/d to select the coin and enter to submit) that are used when the player is using a gamepad
x maybe make it so the player decides at the beginning or title screen to use either a gamepad or keyboard controls
- - - This will detect if any gamepads are present: "if (Input.GetJoystickNames().Length > 0)"
- - - detecting new gamepads/controllers and updating images as they are connected to the game? https://aidantakami.com/2021/02/02/detecting-the-players-controller-type-with-the-unity-input-system/
- - - decided to have the player just check a box for "using gamepad" to get a setting saved for gamepad UI
- - - - - - should make sure that in the future when there is an in-game settings window, the player will have an option to switch the UI between keyboard/gamepad stuff?
- Things that will need to be updated:
Cointoss UI:


### Resolution and UI issues:
- Field feels a bit too narrow/short. Figure out a way to make it wider/taller to give goblins more room to run in?
- - - Current reference resoluation is 512x288 which is a 16:9 resolution that is divisible by 16 on both axises
- - - - - - next 16:9 resolution that is divisible by 16 is 768x432?
- - - - - - would need to set the "Ortho Size" on the cm vcam1 to 13.5. (Currently at 9 for the 512x288 resolution)
- Instead of having the UI for score/time/powerups be a canvas and ui, just have it be images/sprites attached to the camera? Similar to the Q/E/Ball markers?
#Possible "fix" without having to mess with the screen resolution or anything like that:
- Make a second camera called UI-Camera
- - - Depth Only. Culling masking everything
- - - Depth of 1
- - - child of Main Camera
- Set CanvasGameplay to "Screen Space - Camera" and select UI-Camera
- - - Set layer of canvas to UI
- Change the tiles that are not on the field of play to the "AboveGround" tilemap
- - - set layer of AboveGround to UI
- - - will need to "fill out" all the extra space/empty tiles to something to prevent weird rendering issues
- Main Camera
- - - Set to depth only
- - - remove UI layer from the culling masking
- - - depth of 0
- THIS DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IT RUINS THE PIXEL PERFECT AND THE PIXELS ARE COMPLETELY FUCKED UP
#Going with higher resolution of 768x432 for now
- Canvases were all messed up as "Constant Pixel Size"
- for the time being, setting them all to "Scale with Screen Size"
- - - I believe thise means they aren't really going to be "pixel perfect" and may need to redo the UI objects
- - - make the UI objects have more pixels or whatever
- - - at the very least, need to start repositioning stuff so it is at the top and bottom of the screen

### Sound Design stuff
- Basic stuff on how to use audacity for sounds?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kux_LvRl57U&t=376s
- Blipsounds channel - general tutorials on sound creation/design for games
https://www.youtube.com/c/Blipsounds

### Field Max/Min stuff to still update:
x powerup generation
x obstacle generation
x random event generation
x powerup object
x random event object
x obstacle object
x ball possession icon is in the wrong spot
x UI icons on camera for Q/E and Ball stuff
x kick after UI help boxes need to be moved down
x kicking maxY/minY
x dpad symbols on powerups need to be moved up
x kick was good/bad text comes up too early?
x kickoff - when kicking straight ahead, the ball is landing too high? like it's been shifted up?
- - x manually set the y position in football.cs to -1.5f
- - x need to fix how this is adjusting the max/min incorrectly
- - x I think this is fixed now?
x still need to "test" AI behavior
- - - AI seems to behave same as before - that is, chaotics and hard to play!
x football throwing speed and distance should be increased?
- - x original speed of 15 and distance 10. Change to 20/15
x Q/E markers above goblins need to be adjusted to be allowed higher
- - x also make sure their sprite sorting layer is the ui-marker?
- probably more?

### How to "fake" the UI as being behind goblins
- Recreate all the UI elements as sprites attached to the camera
- - - recreate the "groups" that are used by scripts - CanvasGameplay, CanvasCoinToss, etc as empty objects that are parents to all the sprites
- Instead of having the power ups as UI buttons that you navigate through, they will be sprites
- - - then, create transparent/invisible buttons that correspond to those powerup sprites
- - - the invisibile buttons will still be navigable with the UI controls, so when they are selected/submitted you can make the same calls as when the powerups were real buttons
- - - this will hopefully allow for the powerup board to render behind goblins, but still appear to be navigable like they are ui elements
- the thing that may cause issues is text...

### Next steps...
- Create "halves" for the game
- - x Keep track of who kicked/received to start the game
- - x after first gameplay/xtra time ends, go to half time
- - x Whoever kicked to start the game will now receive in second half
- - x make sure gameplay controls are disabled when it's halftime - right now, players can move during the second half kickoff
- - x timer text flashes during second half
- - - game timer stops counting down at 1 for some reason in second half?
- - - - - x phase goes to extra time, but the "xtra-time" text doesn't reappear?
- - - make sure to test that if player scores touchdown during first half xtra-time that they still kick the kickafter
- - - - - x right now, game over gets called after the kick after attempt
- - - - - x after the kick after attempt during first half extra time, the game transitions straight to the kickoff and not the halftime phase
- - - - - x the halftime phase is reached and the UI pops up for it, but the transition to kickoff after kick-after overrides it
- - - - - x add check for kick-after-attempt to only go to kickoff if it is not extra time/halftime?
- - x touchdown text/kick good or back text no longer flashes in second half?
- - - - - x just had to reset the isColorChangeRunning bool to false when they are deactivated
- - - need a UI indicator for what half it is. Probably in the middle of the score board? Make the scoreboard a little bigger?
- Allow players to quit the game when the game ends and get back to main menu
x Have a possession "tracker"
- - x bonuses for longer possessions
- - - - - x longer you have possession, faster you move/heal/recover stamina? Something along those lines
- - x have the bonuses reset after a touchdown is scored
- - x should have a UI indicator / bar to show possession progress
- - x goes up when you have the ball, slowly falls back down when you don't (after a "cooldown" timer or whatever it will start to go down after a few seconds so you don't start losing posssession just when you throw the ball or whatever)
- - x UI indicator will be color coded/change colors when a player reaches new "level" of possession bonus -> blue to yellow or something (try to make it color blind friendly?)
- - - - - x color blind pallettes?: https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23D81B60-%231E88E5-%23FFC107-%23004D40
x "Cowboy Goblin" that appears on the screen near the stands
- - - if it is in your viewport and you press block to raise your hand, you get a "yeehaw"
- - - - - x right now this is just based on distance, calculated on the server. Maybe first have a client side check that uses the camera view port?
- - - game will track how many times you yeehawed the cowboy and display at the end
- - x doesn't actually count for anything in terms of score or whatever
- - x Cowboy enters from one of two identified locations (make them look like stadium tunnels?
- - x add one more animation from of the cowboy bringing their rear leg forward a bit like the last frame of the other goblin run animations
- - x Create a smoking animation where the cowboy grabs their cig and lets out a puff of smoke?
- - - - - x still need to make the particle effect for the exhale of smoke
- - x need to flip the location of the cigarette smoke particle effect when the goblin turns
- Drop kick during gameplay to score (stre
- - - allow players to score 3 points with a drop kick
- - - player can double press the kick button to do a drop kick
- - - - - - will bring up the same accuracy and power bars as a kick after attempt?
- - - - - - kick button once on each to submit
- - - - - - double tap again to cancel and hide UI
- - - when drop kick activated, server will recalculate accuracy bars based on goblin position
- - - some sort of indicator to players that they are in range? or just have them kick normally and if it is short its short and they miss?
- - - - - - allow players to try dropkick even if they are way too far away
- - - - - - a missed dropkick would just be handled like any other kick downfield - gameplay carries on normally
x view stats at end of game
- - x shows comparison of stats for each team, tracked on the team objects
- - x how to get event system "Move/Submit" to change to the UI controls? Also, set the "Main Menu" button as the default selected instead of the powerups
- - - - - - https://forum.unity.com/threads/how-to-switch-the-actions-asset-in-the-input-system-ui-input-module-at-runtime.933000/ ???


### Possession tracker
- States to track and have a countdown for:
- - x when your team has the ball and gain possession points
- - x when you don't have the ball and lose possession points
- - x cooldown after you lose possession but before you lose possession points

### Possession bonuses:
- decrease stamina drain
- increase stamina recovery
- decrease damage taken
- increase health recovery
- speed increase by 1/3rd of possession bonus

### UI Updates
- Half time and end of game UI needs to be updated
- - x Minimum: have some sort of panel that the text is on so it is easier to read
- - x have the rescroll be faster than unscroll?
- After the end of game, option to view stats?
- - x have the scroll rescroll and and then unscroll a new panel?

### Update to 3v3
- Create Lobby Menu
- - - option for 1v1 or 3v3
- - - - - x sets the maximum number of connections variable on the NetworkManager
- - - - - x sets bool for is1v1 or is3v3 or something on NetworkManager - will change how gameplayer and other things work?
- Lobby Menu
- - x allow players to choose team
- - - - - x force 3 max players per team
- - - - - x allow player to set "wants to switch" to true. Used when teams are full (or at least one team has 3)
- - - - - x if two players, one on each team, have "wants to switch" true, then they switch
- - - - - - - - - no switch if only one player?
- - x choose goblin (grenadier/berserker/skirmisher)
- - - - - x from dropdown
- - - - - x change goblin button?
- - - - - x update dropdowns to only show available goblins
- - - - - x make sure when a player quits, their goblin is added back to "available" goblins
- - - - - x when a player joins a lobby, update lobby items to include any selected goblins
- - - - - x when player first joins, update their dropdown list based on what team they are put on?
- - - - - - when player is auto switched, the goblin dropdown doesn't update
- - - - - - - - - keeps same dropdown from their old team?
- - - - - - - - - it looks like it is the player who chose had wantsToSwitch set first that has the issue (the first player to switch). The second player to switch gets the right list
- Coin Toss
- - x make it so the Grenadier of each team is the "captian"
- - x the captain will be the one to select heads/tails and kick/receive
- Kick off
- - - the team captain will always kick
- - x repositioning: must be redone so each player only repositions their goblin
- - x set kicking/receiving team instead of kicking/receiving player?
- - - - - x then loop through teams to have players repositioning themselves
- - - - - x only have kicking team captain activate kicking controls
- - - - - x still set the kicking team captain as "kickingPlayer"?
- Gameplay
- - - still show Q/E goblins for teammates, but you can't "switch" to them
- - - - - x will need to go through each goblin on local players team and set the Q/E goblins locally. Shouldn't need to be on the server?
- - - - - x after cointoss round starts, find all goblin characters. If they are the same time as you, and aren't your selected character/goblinType, make them either the Q/E goblin?
- - - - - x save who the Q/E goblins are locally on the gameplayer and goblin character
- - - - - x when a Q/E player is off screen and they pick up the ball, their side q/e marker stays up until they get rid of the ball?
- - - currently players can always pass, despite being "in front of" the teammate with the ball
- - - - - x whether you can pass or not is based on if serverGamePlayer.doesTeamHaveBall is set to true. If it is true, the server checks if the goblin is further downfield than the ball, if it is false, it doesn't check
- - - - - x serverGamePlayer.doesTeamHaveBall currently only works correctly for 1v1. Need to update for 3v3?
- - - Possession issues
- - - - - x possession is currently only for one player on a team. In 3v3, this is causing some weird issue where a players possession fluctuates between 0 and a bunch of possession if a teammate has the ball but they do not
- - - - - x need to make possession team based and stored on the team object going forward instead of the player? At least for 3v3 games?
- - x punches hurt teammates right now in 3v3. Need to add check to make sure you aren't punching a teammate
- - - ball marker shouldn't be yellow when a teammate has it?
- Kick after
- - x save the scoring player so that they are the ones who kick
- - x save kickingTeam and blockingTeam
- - - - - x will be used for both kick after and the kickoff
- - x recreate kick-after-repositioning so you only move your own goblin if a 3v3 game?
- - x blocking team currently can't move
- - - kicking player and blocking skirmisher were placed correctly. Everyone else was just put in their respective endzone
- - - - - - only tested with green scoring with their skirmisher who was NOT the game host
- - - blocking player set incorrectly. Looks to have just chosen the first player that wasn't the scoring player, even though they were on the same team
- - - "Kick was good" text worked. Did not test missed kicked or blocked kick
- - - goblins correctly repositioned for their kickoff positions, but the football was not moved to the kickoff position or kickoff goblin?
- - x game crashes when player submits their kick after position
- - - - - x was trying to make a "blocking player" do stuff but the blocking player was never set
- - x kick after kicker doesn't get the accuracy bar to come up after the timer
- - x after kick after attempt, blocking team can move around during kick off. Their movement controls aren't disabled
- - - - - x double check?
- Stats
- - x blocked kicks counted twice on grey team?

### Changes to powerups
- Have more powerups affect all goblins on your team, not just the one that you have selected?
- - x attack
- - x defense
- - x heal
- - x speed?
- Have attack/defense/speed buffs last longer? 10 seconds maybe?
- - - if it affects all goblins, probably keep it to the shorter time?
- Defense
- - x increase defense damage buffs
- - x make it so you can't be tripped by a slide tackle?
- - - - - - still will be tripped by obstacles
- Attack
- - x increase attack damage - 1 hit KOs unless they have the defense buff?
x Lightning bolt
- - x find ball carrier - regardless of their team - and zap them?
- - x can accidently zap your own team?
- - x if no one has the ball, zap the opposing captain/selected goblin?
- - - probably change this so it is always the opposing team? or at least always the team in the lead?
- Make throwable/droppable powerups have more than 1 use
- - x Banana
- - x bottle
- New Powerups
- - x Invincibility Star (blue shell)
- - - - - x makes player invulnerable to damage and cannot be tripped by slide tackle or trip objects
- - - - - x last for short period of time: 3-5 seconds?
- - - - - x makes player slightly faster? Maybe just don't have a ball carrier slowdown if you have the star activated so the player still moves fast with the ball?
- - - - - x player will need to flash while invuln. Need to modify the spriteFlash script to keep flashing repeatedly until told to stop? Flash multiple colors?
- - - - - x no ball carrier speed debuff
- - - - - x stamina does not drain while sprinting
- - x Glue
- - - - - x dropped items
- - - - - x leaves patch of ground that slows people who walk on it
- - - - - x need to make the puddle object and the splooge drops that "fall" from the player?
- - x Bomb?
- - - - - x drop items
- - - - - x bomb flashes for 2-3 seconds then blows up
- - - - - x any goblin (friend or foe) within a radius of the bomb is knocked out?
- - - - - x explosion sprite example https://image.shutterstock.com/image-vector/pixel-art-explosions-game-icons-260nw-1120961030.jpg

- Initial sounds to make:
- - x punch
- - - - - x whoosing punch sound before hit (quiet?) - swing stuff in front of mic like spatula and cloths hanger
- - - - - x impact sound if punch lands (loud?er?) - hit something with wooden dowel? jacket? pillow? chair?
- - x bomb explosion
- - x powerup pickup
- - x gain ball possession
- - - - - x different sound for your team gaining possession versus opponent gaining possession
- - - - - - Right now these are crowd sounds for cheering/booing. Maybe change it to something more like "good beep" versus "bad beep"?
- - x ball fumbled sound? Or ball bouncing sound?
- - - - - x can probably be same or similar to the kicked ball sound but quieter? Maybe add some of the "brush" sound in the background for bouncing off grass?
- - - - - x sb011.wav btw
- - x kicked ball
- - - audience sound
- - - - - x cheering for touchdowns?
- - - - - - maybe make cheering/booing sounds and have them play depending on if your team or opponent did a good thing? Or just home/away (green is home, grey away?)
- - x walking through water/glue for slowdowns (plop plop plop?)
- - x brush/weeds slow down sound (some sort of scraping sound?)
- - - running into trip obstacle

- - x berserker
- - x skirmisher
- Throw object sound
- - - quick sound to play when an object is thrown?
- - x bottle
- - x banana
- - x glue drop?
- Ambient crowd noises?

### Sound issues
x water slow down effects
- - - right now on a loop an starts when they enter, stops when they exit
- - - this can cause the clip to end in the middle of the sound or stop before the sounds really "finishes" the first time and sounds bad?
- - - have some way to trigger it in the animation for each "step"?
- - - videos for footstep sounds
- - - - - - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fBKnZM1XE8 "Varying your footsteps based on the terrain in Unity"
- - - - - - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnm8mzxnwP8 "Adding Footstep Sounds to your Unity game with Animation Events"
- - - remember to get rid of the old code for the slow down sounds on the water and brush...
- - x need to add animation event to all run animations for each goblin type, and for each green/grey. Yay...
- Knocked out sound 
- - - if two goblins are knocked out, and one becomes not-knocked-out before the other, the first revived goblin stops playing the knocked out sound
- - - this results in the second goblin still being knocked out while the knock out sound isn't playing
- - - will probably need to make it so the goblins all have their own audio sources instead of the one "SoundManager" audio source?
- - - - - - Keep sound manager for "global" sounds like touchdowns, yeehaws, crowd noises, etc?
- - - - - - goblin audio sources used for goblin specific sounds. Footsteps, punches/other combat, powerup sounds?
- - - - - - will probably be annoying...
- - - - - - seems like it will be an issue going forward for looping sounds generated by goblins? Or any sound that needs to "stop". Knock out and invincibility star sounds?
- Footsteps
- - - footsteps in general are too loud, but especially for other goblins. Either really reduce the sound or remove entirely?

### Single Player AI: What the AI needs to do during phases?
# Coin toss
- - - Detect if AI needs to select coin. If so, randomly choose heads or tails
- - - If AI wins cointoss, or if player loses coin toss, select kick or receive (random? I guess so... maybe weight it out so they favor receiving or something)
# Kick Off
- - - if AI is kicking, needs to perform actions of a kickoff:
- - - - - - select direction of kick
- - - - - - select power of kick
- - - - - - make it mostly random? maybe try the "onside kick" if AI is down, "deep, far kick" if they are up, otherwise random?
# Gameplay
- - - seems like the main thing to add is ball carrier actions? Off ball goblins already have something to "do" from the 1v1 AI
- - - - - - move toward the endzone to score. Dodge opponent goblins
- - - - - - may need to have something more than just simply run in a straight line (as much as possible) toward the endzone. Change "where" in the endzone the ball carrier wants to run to
- - - - - - - - - if player's goblin is on bottom half of field, run toward top and vice versa?
- - - - - - decide when, if ever, to pass?
- - - - - - - - - if the player's goblins are close by, in front of ball carrier, pass?
- - - - - - decide when to kick downfield
- - - - - - - - - near their own endzone, kick. Random power?
- - - - - - - - - maybe make kicking power dependent on how close player is to goblin? Closer, weight to shorter kick as the AI is "panicking" further away better, farther kick?
- - - - - - dive when near endzone to score. If no player goblins nearby, move to center before dive. Otherwise, dive as soon as possible
- - - - - - using powerups?
- - - - - - - - - seems like that might be hard. Maybe some rules like use speed/defense/stamina when they have the ball and are trying to score, 
- - - - - - - - - - - - attack/bottle when defending?
- - - - - - - - - - - - drop powerups like banana/glue when player goblins are behind them?
- - - - - - - - - will need to tell the AI to pickup powerups too? Yikes
- - - - - - AI will use block and stuff when they have the ball and a player goblin is within a certain distance from them?
- - - - - - sprint most of the time, but especially when they have the ball? Have the AI randomly at times sprint to much and get fatigue, other times stop sprinting to let it charge back up to full/some part way?
# Kick After
- - - if kicking, determine how "hard" the kick is
- - - - - - try to make the kick as "easy" as possible
- - - - - - - - - move back for better angle and stuff like that
- - - - - - when taking the kick, wait some amount of time based on how hard the kick is, then kick
- - - - - - depending on how hard the kick is, determine how likely the AI is to make it. Easy kicks down the middle, almost always make. Harder kicks from the sidelines, make <50% or whatever
- - - if not kicking, just run right at the kick as fast as possible to block it?
# Something else?

### Tasks for singleplayer
x Spawn goblins for player
x Spawn AI player object?
x Spawn goblins for AI
# Coin Toss
x Determine if the player or AI will select heads or tails based on if they are the grey team or not
- - x CPU picks randomly (normally) but for now have them pick tails so they get prompted for the kick/receive choice
- - x check "HandleDoesPlayerChooseCoin" in GamePlayer.cs and make sure it is only executed for the local player for singleplayer
- - - - - x actually, check CmdDoesPlayerChooseCoin and add checks for this.isSinglePlayer. Right now its setting it false to both the player and AI because there is no isSinglePlayer check
x After coin toss, determine who chooses kick or receive
- - x if it is CPU, they will then choose randomly?
x Reposition the Goblins for the kick after attempt based on if the player/cpu choose kick/receive
- - x goblins don't get repositioned right now. Look at RepositionTeamsForKickOff to add checks for isSinglePlayer?
- - x right now, it is calling RpcRepositionTeamForKickOff3v3 which uses the player's goblinType to move one goblin. Switch to call RpcRepositionTeamForKickOff with checks for isSinglePlayer so that the AI player doesn't have controls set?
# Kick off
x Player has their kickoff controls enabled, but can't actually adjust their aim or kick?
- - - - - x pressing w/s never calls StartAimArrowDirection like it should?
- - - - - x I'm a moron. it is up/down arrow that changes aim, function is called
- - - - - x for some reason, the player's "selected" goblin is the skirmisher even though the grenadier has the ball?
- - - - - - - - - issue was calling the AddToGoblinTeam function and not having a isSinglePlayer check when adding goblins to team
- - x also, when they are receiving, they have Q/E controls enabled but can't actually switch?
- - - - - x the Q/E SwitchToQGoblin functions have checks for is1v1 that will need to be updated for isSinglePlayer
- - - - - x pressing Q/E does "work" in that the functions are called
x When AI has to kick, they need to kick!
- - x wait a second or two (maybe even 5 seconds!) first
- - x randomly select kick angle based on min/max range
- - x randomly select kick power
- - x then kick
- - - - - - CmdKickFootball on selected goblin
- - x the "randomly" stuff for angle/power can be adjusted later and weighted based on scenario, but for now, just make it random?
# Gameplay
x Right now, the player controls both their selected goblin and the AI's goblin
- - x because the check is if isSelected and hasAuthority, which the player has over the AI goblin as well, so they start moving
- - x add isSinglePlayer and myGamePlayer.isLocalPlayer checks to the goblin?
x Need to have ball carrier move around on their own?
- - x find endzone, run toward it
- - - - - x find nearby goblins and adjust "where" in the endzone the goblin is running toward
- - - - - x only have the goblin run in a straight line toward the endzone unless there are nearby goblins? Adjust the "Y" value of the myEndZone Vector3 so they don't always run toward the middle
- - x Check for nearby enemy goblins. If they are close, check for possible "passes" to make?
- - - - - x if nearby goblins are close, check line-of-sight paths to teammates, make pass if no enemy goblins are in the way?
- - x if ball carrier has ball near their own endzone, kick ball downfield?
- - - The AI player passes a bunch and honestly is too good at it... maybe make it so the checks to pass are harder to be true? have a timer or something that waits a quarter second before actually passing?
- - - - - x if there is a timer, have it set a bool variable that skips the kick/pass checks and just keeps the goblin running until they pass?
- - - - - x also, the "ThrowBall" function in GoblinScript has no checks for isKnockedOut or doesCharacterHaveBall. Maybe add those????
- - - - - x also added a "&& !throwingGoblinScript.isGoblinKnockedOut" check to football.cs's CmdThrowFootball function
# Kick after attempt
x right now, goblins don't reposition for the kick after no matter who scores touchdown
- - x add isSinglePlayer checks?
- - x look at SetKickAfterPlayers in GameplayManager?
- - x game is crashing on FollowSelectedGoblin in GamePlayer.cs? Probably from telling the AI player to follow a selected goblin?
- - x scoring goblin does get repositioned, whether player or AI, but no one else
- - - AI goblins get repositioned first time but not second: areGoblinsRepositionedForKickAfter needs to be reset, but is only reset on the local game player not the AI
x when player is kicking and submits kick after position, game crashes with a bunch of errors
- - x looks to be from StartKickAfterTimer since it only has a is1v1 check. Add isSinglePlayer checkk
- - - - - x make sure that the AI player doesn't get sent the countdown message through RpcStartKickAfterTimer?
- - x will crash again after the countdown before the kick attempt
- - - - - x KickAfterTimerCountDown makes calls to the scoring/blockingPlayers. Make checks for isSinglePlayer and also ignore calls to the AI player?
x When AI is kicking and choosing kick position:
- - x have some sort of "minimum" kickAfterAccuracyDifficulty value to try and get
- - x AI will try and move back and forth until they get that minimum
- - x check for trip obstacles so the AI doesn't trip on them? Or make it so they can randomly do it by accident like 10% of the time?
x When player is kicking
- - x have AI goblins run at the player to block the kick after the countdown timer
 
### AI Things to fix/add
x Fix logic around when to dive in endzone
- - x when goblin is near endzone, check for nearby enemies
- - - - - x if no enemies nearby, run toward center of endzone
- - - - - - - - x add a "center of endzone" variable for each endzone to then set as the new target position?
- - - - - x if there is an enemy nearby, dive straight ahead
- The "avoidDirection" logic is messed up and results in a goblin going to the corner of the endzone most of the time?
- - - maybe instead have the AdjustEndzonePositionBasedOnEnemyGoblins function just check if more goblins are above/below the ball carrier?
- - x or just have the multiplier be smaller? It's currently "positionToRunToward.y += (avoidDirection.y * 10f)"
- - - - - x make it something like *2.5f instead of 10?
- - - If there are a lot of opponent goblins right in front of a goblin, they will run backwards. Should make a check to make sure the AI never runs straight back
- - - - - - maybe makr sure their "angle" is always at least straight up/down, or maybe can be a little backward?
- - - - - - check to see if the "directionOfEndzone" variable's x value is in the opposite direction of the endzone. 
- - - - - - - - - If yes, adjust so the goblin runs at 45 degree angle backward
- - - - - - - - - determine if angle is up or down based on the y value of directionOfEndzone. Positive = up, negative = down
x When a powerup is picked up by the AI, make sure that the image isn't added to the player's PowerUp UI
x Have some sort of way for the AI to use powerups?
- - x check if the AI has any powerups
- - - if they do have powerups, make checks for powerup usage scenarios?
- - - - - x if enemies nearby and AI has the ball, use the defense/banana/glue/speed/stamina?
- - - - - x if enemies nearby and player has ball, use the attack/bottle
- - - - - x something that would also cause AI to use speed/stamina if the player has the ball and all AI goblins are far away and need to catch up?
- - x should add a "category" type for each powerup to make the above checks easier/quicker for the AI?
- - - - - x if enemy is nearby and AI has ball, use first "defense" powerup available?
x Should probably have an AI PowerUp UI so the player can see what powerups the AI does have?
- - x just duplicate the player powerup ui and flip the side?
x have AI "sprint" at times?
- - - will be tricky coming up with the logic on when to sprint? When the AI has the ball? when the player has the ball and is closer to endzone than the AI?
- - x for ball carrier: seems to work?
- - x When not the ball carrier?
x Modify the "get open for pass" checks so that the goblins aren't always so "deep" behind the ball carrier? They can be closer up?
- New state for when team has ball but is near their own endzone. The non-ball carriers can run down the field anticipating a kick downfield?
x When AI goblins slide, they gain 1.2x speed and it never goes back down?
- - x CmdIsPlayerSprinting is never called to reset goblin speed or something?
x Logic for when the AI goblin should sprint?
- - x If they have the ball and an enemy is nearby, but behind?
- - x if they are chasing the ball carrier, and the ball carrier is far away (more than "5" distance or something?)
- - x some "fuzziness" on getting fatigued? Maybe when they start sprinting, set a fatigue chance randomly?
x Sometimes AI seems to ignore the ball carrier of the other team and focuses on another "target"
- - - fix the FindNearByGoblinToTarget to make sure at least one, if not two, goblins are targeting the ball carrier? Skirmisher always targets ball carrier if able?
- - x probably just change it so all goblins always go after the ball carrier? Seems like no reason not too...
x Times to "reset" the sprinting parameters:
- - x after touchdown is scored
- - x after kick after attempt is made
- AI Goblins can get "stuck" on each other and form a cluster
- - - Add logic to avoid that?
- - - Every 0.5 seconds (or however long), check how far goblin has moved. If it isn't past a certain distance, dive?
- - - - - - or just change the direction to be the opposite of where they are trying to move to? perpendicular instead of opposite?
- - x detection for "teammate collision" - when a goblin collides with a teammate, add a new direction modifier that is perpindicular to teammate for the next 0.25 seconds?
x If kick is "blocked" right after kick is released, the "blocked kick" text appears on top of kick is good/bad
- - x make checks to make sure that the block kick thing only happens when the goblin still has doesCharacterHaveBall as true
- - - don't make the blocked kick UI pop up if the good/bad kick ui is up?
x When kick was blocked before half time, my "Game Play Controls" were not reset?
- - x was able to move around as a goblin
- - x during the kick after, I was the blocking team and the opponent was the kicking team. The opponent tripped on a trip object
- Make it so punches and slide tackles and only hit one goblin?
- - x Punches can't go "through" more than one goblin
- - x save the goblin that is hit. Start timer of like 0.5 seconds to reset the goblin afterward?
- - x keep it so multiple goblins can be tripped by one slide tackle? It kind of makes sense that someone could trip multiple people if they slid into them?
- - - maybe make it so that the berserker and only the berserker can hit multiple goblins since they are swinging a club and not punching? Gives the berserker a bit of a bonus too?


### Misc things to add?
- Option to sprint with a toggle when you press the sprint button instead of having to hold it down?
- - - toggle set on the gameplayer, goblin checks their game player owner to see if toggle is on, and if it is, tell server they are sprinting? during the Move() checks?
- Fix running animations so there isn't a frame with both feet on the ground
x For kick after, have camera follow football shadow toward the goal post?
x On kick off st up, have camera move to 0,0, then reset to follow the selected goblin
- - x this is to make sure that the player can see midfield/where the kick is occuring at kickoff
- - x the fix was setting the camera's "PreviousStateIsValid" to false when the gamephase is kickoff
x Blue shell idea: rocket propelled bottles that home in on enemy goblins?
x have the regular grass tiles be more random
- - x define specific "grass tiles", randomly choose them
- - x just trying to make sure that the field doesn't look quite as bland/patterned?
- - x use 2d tilemap extras and the random brush?
- - - - - x https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@1.6/manual/RandomBrush.html
- - x should probably add some "random" tiles for the hash lines and stuff so that appears more random?
- - - - - x maybe 2-4 variations for each "type" of line tile?
- animate the crowds?
- - x just have them move up/down left/right with a random offset so it isn't too patterned?
- - x not a huge deal
- - x 2d tilemap extras has an "animated tile" function that potentially be used for this?
- - - - - x https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.tilemap.extras@1.6/manual/AnimatedTile.html
- - - - - x https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/animated-tiles-unity-a9fa47103296
- - x Bottom half of the stands looked really bad animated so I got rid of that and only did the top half?
x Indicator for when you can't dive?
- - x after a dive or slide goblins can't dive again. Maybe reuse the sweat drop to show the player when they can/can't dive?
- Escape menu:
- - x allow for player to press esc/start to bring up a menu
- - - - - x quit game
- - - - - - settings menu (when that is created...)
- - x ability for host to "pause" the game?
- - - - - x stop game timer
- - - - - x prevent everyone from moving
- - - - - x pause menu tutorial? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JivuXdrIHK0
- - - - - x pause without setting timescale to 0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPaEnLpu57s
- - - - - x pause menu for multiplayer using PUN? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaipT1NeyAM
- - - - - x someone trying and failing to make a pause menu? https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-mirror-simple-pause-menu-ui-not-working-in-multiplayer.1082147/
- - x Will need to "save" the current player's controls that are enable (QEswitching, goblin movement, kick off aiming, coin toss controlls, etc.)
- - - - - x will also need to save changes to controls? If the esc menu is open during a gamephase change and the player's controls change, save those changes to be restored later?
- - - - - x in the "Enable Controls" functions, such as EnableGameplayActions, have it call the EscMenuManager to save the new control update?
- - - - - - or just have the game close the esc menu from the "Enable Controls" functions. If there are any controls changes, the EscMenu closes automatically without restoring old controls?
- - x make it so a team can only pause the game every 30seconds or whatever
- Add "timeouts" to things outside of the gameplay phases
- - x kickoff
- - - - - - just kick straight ahead at half power after 30 seconds?
- - x cointoss
- - - - - - select heads/kick automatically if no player input is received?
- - x kick after
- - - - - x if kick has not been made after 30 seconds, automaticly block the kick?
- - x 30 second countdown or whatever to prevent the game from "hanging" because someone isn't playing?
- Migrate the host to another player if the host leaves?
- - - not sure if that will be possible with mirror...
x Update TitleScreen scene's UI so it isn't so bad?
- - x look more like the Stalks UI? at least that's something more presentable
x Implement the "mercy rule" feature
- - x after every score or point change, check if mercy rule is enabled
- - x if point differential is equal to or greater than mercy rule amount, end the game?
x When game is paused, during the PauseGameTimeoutRoutine have it send the pause time left to each client
- - x client will then update a text object to show seconds left for the pause
x Add an "outline" to characters when they have the ball as yet another visual indicator?
- - x https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84rZ-rCRsZk - "shader graph" to add outline?
x Since switching to universal render pipeline, the "blur" material/shader for the esc menu doesn't work and is just grey?
- - x fix? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhasSbe7Xes
- - x what I used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjfNgra1uWk

### Custom Settings per game?
x Time per half
x powerups on/off
x blue shells on/off
- - - got rid of this. only have the on/off for powerups not blue shells also
x random events on/off
x obstacles on/off
x mercy rule? max point differential

### Trailer timestamps?
- 2 - 0:53 - juke for touchdown?

### Resolution pixel ratio mapping
- 3840x2160 (4k) - 6
- 2560x1440 - 4
- 1920x1080 - 3
- 1600x900 - 2.5
- 1280x720 - 2

### Things to add/update before release?
- Fix running animations so 2 feet aren't on the ground
- - x regular running
- - x running with ball
- - x running punch
- - x running block
- - x running block with ball
- x x grenadier
- x x berserker
- - x skirmisher
x Make it so the defense powerup prevents slide tackle trips?
- - x goblins take damage still, but aren't tripped
- will need to remember to "flip" the diving hurtbox when the goblin changes direction?
- - - This is already done to other colliders in the RpcFlipRenderer function. Just add the diving hurtbox to that?
- - - this may have already been done?
x make it so shadows are now a object on each goblin that's just a circle/oval that is normally grey and transparent
- - x when the goblin picks up the ball, change the shadow to:
- - - - - x your goblin: white and less transparent
- - - - - x opposing goblin: yellow and less transparent
- - - - - - - x did a different thing instead for the above two. New oval shaped indicator for who has ball. Kill myself.
- - x maybe make it so all goblins have a regular shadow that doesn't change, and then have a circle under their feet that is activated only when they pick up the ball?
- - x make the shadow's "order in layer" be 0? The "has ball circle" 1?
- - x remove the shadows from every sprite sheet for every goblin...
- - - - - x make the new shadows slightly bigger for all goblins and also make them better centered?
- - - - - x right now the shadows all seem to be shifted to the right, at least for the skirmisher/berserkers
- - - - - - - - x may need to just "flip" them like the hitboxes...
- - - - - - - - - or just undo everything and have the shadows drawn on the sprites... would just need to add them back to the running sprites...
- - x To have the circle render behind its goblin but in front of others:
- - - - - x make the sprite bigger/taller and have the pivot point be just below where the goblins would be?
- - - - - - - - x Take the goblin sprite, place the circle where you want it on the goblin's feet, delete the goblin, export/save
- - - - - - - - x in unity's sprite editor, set the pivot point up "high" on the circle, but make it so the pivot would be one pixel below the goblin's center?
- - - - - - - - x then set the circle's "sprite sort point" from center to pivot?
- - - - - - - - x none of the above works because the sprite needs to be "below" on the y-axis to render in front. Can't accomplish this so the sprite is "below" a goblin in front of me but also being "above" my own goblin while my own goblin is rendered behind the goblin in front of me
x have a sprint indicator?
- - x try to get the particle effect thing to work again?
- - x have the particle trigger when the rear foot is extended back and front foot raised
- - - - - x particles would be moving back when front foot hits ground and rear foot is up in new running anims
- - - - - x changed it so the particle is played when rear foot is lifted. Looks better?
- - x anime speed lines instead (or in combination with) the smoke effect?
- - - - - x https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWjpkhShB28
- - - - - x stupid bullshit don't ever do
x Settings menu in game
x potential issue to trouble shoot/test:
- - x can players open esc menu during halftime or end of game?
- - x can players pause during halftime/end of game?
- - x this is fine as far as I can tell? Players can open the escape menu and pause, but the game seems to resume normally?
- - x when a player pauses during halftime/end of game, the "resuming in XX seconds..." message is hidden by the score/end of game/stats menu
- - - - - x lowered the "resuming in" text so it is below the half-time scroll
- - - - - x made it so you can't pause during gameover by adding a "if gameover, return" statement in PauseGameOnServer
x Issue: Multiplayer lobby broken at resolution of 1600x900?
- - x only tested on single player right now. The UI doesn't scale for some reason and looks huge?
- - x swaped out the "CanvasScaler" script for "CanvasScalerTitleScreen" on the Lobby UI canvas
- Issue: Goblin cowboy randomly started walking "too high" and above the stands. Not sure what caused it. Happened in a singleplayer game when I was pausing a bunch?
x diving "dodges" a bomb?
x create initial trailer
x crop out the "gifs.com" watermark from all gifs on the store page...
- - x open gif in gimp, resize canvas, export as new gif
- - - - - x resize to 560 width?
- - - - - x make sure to check "as animation" in the "Export Image as GIF" options
- - x slide tackle
- - x touchdown
- - x kick downfield
- - x powerups
- - x dodge rowdy crowd
- menu/UI navigation with the escape menu and the PowerUps is still all messed up?
- - x issue is that the buttons in the escape menu have an "automatic" navigation set
- - - - - x so, if you go up from "back to game" you will select the powerup UI icons
- - x have explicit navigation for the top/bottom buttons
- - - - - x make the rest "vertical" navigation only
- - x make checks on the "Back to Game" and "Settings" buttons to check if the game is single player or not (no pause button in single player)
- - - - - x if single player, replace back to game's "Select on Down" from the pausegamebutton to the settings button?
- make sure that menu/UI navigation works when switching between esc menu and the settings menu?
- - x when the settings menu is loaded, no buttons are "selected" and you can't navigate with arrow keys or the gamepad
- - x make it so the OpenSettingsMenu and BackToEscMenu functions of the EscMenManager script set the selected buttons explicitly?
- - - - - x unsure if this will work for the settings menu since the button won't be activated until after the "unscroll" animation?
x For the settings menu, instead of querying the system for available resolutions, explicitly state the follow resolutions:
- - x 1280x720
- - x 1600x900
- - x 1920x1080
- - x 2560x1440
- - - - - x make sure that the system's monitor/whatever supports the higher resolutions? Try to get a min/max supported resolution?
- Add "show Gamepad UI controls" or whatever it's called to the titlescreen settings and in-game settings
- - x add to titlescreen UI
- - - For in-game change to gamepad UI, the following needs to be updated:
- - - - - x camera markers
- - - - - - - - x need to add new variables to CameraMarker.cs to save the q/e marker sprites. Right now, if gamepadUI is set to true, qMarkerLeftCanPass/etc. gets overwritten with the gamepad sprites. The original sprites are essentially lost. Need to save those sprites somewhere. basically copy every eMarkerLeftCanPass/etc. and make them eMarkerLeftCanPassSprite/etc.
- - - - - x markers above all goblins
- - - - - - - - x still need to test in a 3v3 game
- - - - - - - - x in 3v3 had weird issue where the camera markers could become unsynced from the gamepadUI setting if a different window "saved" the settings. I think this is due to the different windows using the same playerpref values in the registry? idk. Issue was when another goblin that the player didnt control had the ball. The window of the goblin with the ball then changed their gamepad UI setting and saved (thus saving for everyone). Then, when the goblin with the ball got rid of the ball, their camera marker was stuck on the old gamepad UI setting until it was toggled again (but not saved)
- - - - - x I think GameplayManager.cs already dynamically sets the instruction texts based on if gamepadUI is true/false? As in, it makes the if(gamepadUI) check every time instructions text is used?
- - - - - - - - x probably should have EnableGamepadUIFromSettingsMenu check what gamephase it is. If it is something like coin toss/kick after/whatever, make calls to the functions that set the instruction text for those phases?
- - - - - x power up images (the "1/2/3/4" and d-pad images) need to be updated
x Make sure that the title screen UI is navigable by the game pad?
- - x yikes
- - x top bar navigates only left to right. Only can navigate down when their "panel" below is activated?
- - x going to far to the left or right, or up, goes to the quit game button
- - - - - x quit game button can go left/right to the top bar. Up/Down just go to the first item in the top bar?
- - - - - x maybe have the quit button's "up" dynamically change to the panel items if they are active?
x add a esc menu and settings menu to the lobby scene?
- - - this seems more annoying than anything and also doesn't help at all?
x AI goblins still keep doing the "running" animation after a touchdown is scored
- - x should just have to reset goblin statuses or whatever is done at the beginning of kick after attempts and kick offs?
x punches thrown stats are wrong?
- - x played a single player game and my team had 0 punches thrown?
- - x I think what is happening is that only punches "thrown" by a goblin selected by the player are counted in this stat? maybe make it so all punches are counted?
- - x removed checks for "isCharacterSelected" and fixed.
x When you escape the esc menu with the settings menu still open, then reopen the esc menu, the settings menu remains open
- - x when closing the esc menu with the esc key, have EscMenManager check if settings menu is open and if so, unroll the settings menu and hide it?
x navigate out of input fields with gamepad. May need to have GetOutOfInputField.cs using the  InputControls and detect any move inputs?
x Add a "was punched" indicator. Maybe just an "X" symbol that appears on their head, or a bandaid
- - x should appear near where the fatigue indicator is?
x make it so if a goblin is blocking, they don't take the "was punched" slow down?
- - x also made it so the defense power up prevents the slow down as well
- transitions between scenes?
- - - may be helpful, especially for singleplayer, for there to be a real transition between titlescreen/lobby and the gameplay scene
- - - brackey's scene transition tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE9VOZivb3I
- - - loading bar? https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=unity+loading+screen
x "How To Play" page of the title screen?
- - x hopefully it can just be text and images that the player scrolls through?
- - x tutorials on in-game tutorialis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deuf1H5Wu1E https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be0C8FXGPrA
- maybe add some "screen" effects
- - - corners of the screen change color based on some event
- - - - - - red when your goblin is punched, white when your team picks up the ball, yellow when they lose the ball?
- - - - - - the change of possession stuff can reuse the cheer/boo sound triggers for when possession changes?
x add a delay/limit how often you can block
- - x right now you can spam blocking while running. Doesn't seem like it affects speed much. Unsure if it gives you the blocking defense bonus
- - x when blocking is released, save timestamp. Don't allow for another block until after a certain time. Probably only needs to be like 0.5 seconds
- - x I don't think spamming was every really an issue because when you spam the block command, even when you are the host, the isBlocking value doesn't get set until you've held it for like a quarter second so mashing the key for block basically means you aren't really blocking ever?
x Make it so you can use powerups by just move the right stick in a specific direction
- - x Look at SelectPowerUps -> SelectLeftOrRightComposite for reference
- - - - - x change it so there is an up/down/left/right bound to the right stick movement directions
- - - - - x have values read into a Vector2 and a function reads it
- - - - - x if value in any direction is >0.71f, set appropriate direction
- - - - - - - - - (-1.0,0.0) = left = 0
- - - - - - - - - (0.0,1.0) = up = 1
- - - - - - - - - (1.0,0.0) = right = 2
- - - - - - - - - (0.0,-1.0) = down = 3
- - - - - x have timer cooldown between reading the analog stick and submitting to UsePowerUp?
- - - - - - - - x or use boolean value wasRightStickUsedToSelect. Set to true when action is performed. Set back to false when action is cancelled?
- - - - - - - - x see how the goblin movement works when reading values?
- - - - - - - - - - - x InputManager.Controls.Player.Move.performed += ctx => SetMovement(ctx.ReadValue<Vector2>());
- - - - - - - - - - - x InputManager.Controls.Player.Move.canceled += ctx => ResetMovement();
- - - - - x the above seems to work in the tutorial game. Add to regular gameplay???
x if player pauses/opens esc menu during end of game, make sure that when they close the esc menu the "main menu" button is selected again for gamepad UI navigation?
- - x only confirmed this is an issue in singleplayer so far?
x re-mapping controls D:
- - x https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUCcZrPhwSo
- - x https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBBbpbIRoIc - persistent key binding?
- - x better one to use: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csqVa2Vimao
- - - - - x when check for duplicates, create a serialized field that is an array of all action maps
- - - - - - - - x not actually all, but the important "gameplay" ones like switch goblins and player actions?
- - - - - - - - x check through each action map and see if the new binding key exists in an action map
- - - - - - - - x not sure what to do for gamepad because there won't be any "available" keys since everything is mapped already?
- - - - - x When saving, change it so the save function is a public func that is called by pressing a button, instead of just "onDisable"?
- - - - - - - - x or just leave it as onDisable so player's don't need to worry about forgetting to save it?
- - - recreate the "multiple With Cancelling Through" stuff by doing something similar to CheckDuplicateBindings in the onComplete section of PerformInteractiveRebind
- - - - - - how some people did it: https://forum.unity.com/threads/withcancelingthrough-keyboard-escape-also-cancels-with-keyboard-e.1233400/
- - - - - - basically, check for input, if it is esc/start/select, then removeBindingOverride and cleanup(), then return?
- - - - - - how to check the submitted binding though???
- - x make it so the "reset" button for an individual binding also checks for duplicates
- - - - - x want to make sure that when you reset a binding to default, another binding isn't using its default path. If it is, switch the duplicate binding to something else
- - x for gamepad, make sure that not is ever set to a path with the left stick and right stick?
- - x make it so the duplicate checks are for more than just the current action map (like Controls.Player). It should also check other action maps
- - - - - x Player, QESwitchGoblins, PowerUps
x turn off the game audio listener or whatever its called when the game is paused
- - x if you don't you can get stuck listening to sounds that are looped
- - x seemed more annoying than anything so I decided not to do this???
- - - maybe make it instead so the audio listener is only turned off if the game is paused? That's different than the escape menu open...

x keyboard controls not working in tutorial?
- - - "fixed" by calling CloseMenu from the escmanager. No idea what is causing the issue
- slow down effect issue where the slow down "material" or whatever like the glue disappeared and the player still stayed at the slower speed
- - - had to run into another slow down area and leave to reset speed
- - - maybe have it so when a slow down effect is set, start a ~3 second timer
- - - - - - check if the player is still in the slow down area. If not, remove the effect?
