### Bowling Game:
- super bowling lane starts at 222px and narrows to 66 px : 3.36 to 1
- - - mine 128 to 70: 1.82 to one
- - - should be down to 38 on mine??? or start at 235
- Maybe use SNES resolution of 256x224?
- - - or just halve current resolution to 384x216? 320x180? 640x360?
Oil slick
# simple way
- 3 oil states: full saturated, half saturated, none
- - -on "none" ball movement is affect by spin of the ball normally
- - - on fully saturated, ball movement is completely unaffected by ball spin. Ball continues in the direction it entered saturated state in
- - - on half saturated, ball movement is affect by spin of ball by half
- ball "carries" oil from one area to the next as it rolls
- floor is divided into sections, each with an oil "status" (full, half, none"
- as ball goes down floor, it will hit a fully saturated area, and take some of that area's oil, and "drop it" onto the next section 
- - - when ball enters a section, it takes a certain percentage of oil from the section, say 10%
- - - - - - when the ball enters the next section, it drops off a certain percentage of the oil on the ball, say 80%
- - - - - - eventually the ball will lose all its oil (or close to it) and no longer leave oil behind on new sections 
- - - the section will eventually have enough oil added to it to change state: from no oil to half saturated
- - - this will continue throughout a game, changing what sections have oil as the player plays
- maybe break up the sections in two columns down the lane, a left and a right, so one side can have more oil than the other over time
- - - players will be right/left handed (and possibly ambidextrous, with a penalty). Right handed can curve to the left easier, left handed curve ball to right easier
- - - - - - so if right handed bowler starts in right side and always curves left toward the center, the right side will fill with oil, making it harder to keep throwing from same spot
- - - signify amount of oil visually. Some sort of "oil slick" pattern that is different for each oil amount tier
- - - - - - also have an "oil vision" ability that clearly marks oil levels
- - - could also just have a small grid for the sections. Like a 5x10 grid or something, with colliders for each grid section to track when the ball enters and leaves a section 

# more complex way
- same as above but instead of having square sections or whatever, I actually draw streaks of oil

Bowling the ball
- player selects trajectory and then tries to hit it, like golf
- player selects power/ speed, and also spin
- - - spin applies curves to trajectory 
- - - power will affect spin's curve. More power, wider curve. Less power, tighter curve
- - - power will also be used for speed calculations for when the ball hits the pins 
- after power/spin is selected, markers are put in two meters (power: up and down. Spin: side to side). Icon moves back and forth, players need to stop the icons on their markers to hit their bowl accurately
- player stats affect how big the markers are?
- - - player with "good spin" has a wide marker on the meter to hit their spin target, also wider meter overall. Wider meter means a wider curve is possible
- - - power players same as above, but for power meter. Bugger power meter to indicate the player can bowl harder/faster

Power ups
- sniper - shoot down one pin to count toward your frame
- Bomb - can knock down all pins if you "hit" the target. Player spins around in a circle with the bomb like a shot putter/hammer toss. Arrow will spin. Player has to press button to stop arrow straight ahead three times in a row to hit their lane
- - - if player hits adjacent lane, it knocks over half the pins on that side
- oil spill - place oil on specific section(s) to grease up an area (good for competitive?)
- towel boy - cleanup and remove oil from specified section(s)
