### new game idea for after (at least trying to) finishing the level editor

# Gameplay Idea
- combination of CardConquest and that HeroCard game/slay the spire?
- - - Goblin units that you command on a hex grid
- - - You have a "hand" of cards that you play during battles
- - - Player and enemy AI
- - - - - - potentially make multiplayer?
- - - - - - - - - a "versus" mode where one player is trying to stop the other from advancing through the game / playing in stead of the CPU player
- - - - - - - - - 3 person teams? Just increase map size and enemy unit amount?
- - - You are escorting a bomb you must protect from enemies
- - - - - - win a level by killing all enemy units or capturing the enemy "base"/stronghold? on the level
- - - reach "check points" where you drop off a bomb to explode
- - - - - - will be a "boss" battle of sorts
- - - - - - - - - four bosses? Maybe five
- - - if all your units die, you lose. Start over?
- - - - - - maybe have player chose to start over or at last checkpoint
- - - if enemy captures your bomb, you lose
- - - - - - can attach bomb to units to make escorting easier
- - - - - - but if that unit is killed, the bomb is captured
- - - At the beginning of each turn, get new cards
- - - - - - maybe show player 2 cards, they choose one
- - - - - - - - - cards are random per level?
- - - - - - then player can remove a certain number of cards. The "power" of the discarded cards can go toward a currency, that is spent on new cards?
- - - - - - - - - currency doesn't carry over though, use it or lose it?
- - - - - - - - - maybe can also use discarded card power to buy power ups?
- - - the "checkpoints" are where boss battles will be
- - - - - - player needs to drop bomb off at boss camp/outpost
- - - - - - boss music!
- - - - - - bosses are like a siege or something? Player is trying to take a "castle" type structure
- - - - - - - - - hexes are marked as fortications
- - - - - - - - - player can take them one by one, or go through to the "heart" of the outpost and immediately defeat them
- - - - - - center of outpost will have the boss unit
- - - - - - - - - special character. Extra strong. Will have some unique abilities like more attack/whatever, special modifiers in battles, stuff like that
- - - - - - - - - - - - new sprite for each...
- - - - - - - - - Boss idea: bomb thrower
- - - - - - - - - - - - throws bombs towards your units, especially focused on the unit with the bomb (or just at the bomb if you aren't carrying it)
- - - - - - - - - - - - bombs take 2 turns to exploded: damage anything in a 1 tile radius from the bombs tile
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - if your bomb/bombcarrier is in an explosion radius, your bomb detonates and you lose!
- - - - - - - - - - - - bombs that take 3 turns, explosion radius of 2?
- - - when a boss is defeated, choose between two upgrades?
- - - - - - each upgrade randomly chosen? Or have an option to have "set" upgrades?
- - - player must kill the final boss to beat the game or "run"
- - - new run+?
- - - - - - give player's option to due more runs if they beat one, make it substantially harder?
- - - - - - only way to carry over to next game?
- - - maybe after a player makes a run, they can keep 1 power up or 1 card to carry over to next run?
- - - - - - way to "upgrade" in some sense between runs, making subsequent runs easier?
- - - - - - get more units, cards, better starting cards, greater hand size to start, etc?
- - - - - - maybe the way you upgrade is the collective value of the deck you built
- - - - - - - - - use that value to buy permenant upgrades, like discussed above?
- procedurally generate each new "level"?
- - - also have the enemy squad generated new for each level
- - - and the enemy's hand
# Lore?
- team of sapper goblins escorting bomb through mines
- - - need to proect the bomb from attackers
- - - if enemy captures your bomb, you lose


### Tasks to get a PoC going?
- Creating a hex grid with hex tiles

- - - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt6hM6f9-Dk
- - - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nXmuJuWS8I
- movement on a hex grid
- - - https://youtu.be/htZijEO7ZmE?si=gfo-SYl1lne9AJIT
- generate a hex grid
- - - load from a saved "map"/json file
- - - auto generate a new level, with tiles you can move on and tiles you can't (obstacles and walls)
- - - - - - walls surrounding the outside of the level
- AI/Opposing player moves their characters in response to yours
- - - AI will move toward player and their bomb
- - - AI will attack if they have an advantage (greater army than player on a tile) or if they don't have a path to retreat)
- player achieving goal (capturing the flag/planting bomb) ends level, new level is generated
- cards and battle system following card conquest
- - - detect battles
- - - show player and oppnent decks/hands
- - - player chooses card
- - - opponent AI chooses their "best" card if they can win, "worst" card if it looks like a sure defeat

### First steps to get started
- Created a hex grid with tiles
- - - try as hex first (flat top? pointy top?)
- - - - - - see this aseprite tool for creating hex tiles? https://www.reddit.com/r/aseprite/comments/1awquqn/created_a_tool_for_creating_isometric_hexagonal/
- - - - - - CodeMonkey tutorial was for pointy top. I think for flat top all I'd change is have a horizontal offset of 0.75 instead of a vertical offset. So, change HEX_VERTICAL_OFFSET_MULTIPLIER to HEX_Horizontal_OFFSET_MULTIPLIER
- - x if creating hex pixel art tiles is too difficult/annoying, just switch to a rectangle grid
- - - - - x think Core Keeper for asethetic
- Detect mouse click on a grid tile
- - - highlight the correct grid position when clicked on
x Have a unit that is on the grid
- - x make unit selectable by clicking on them
- - - - - x selectable by clicking on the tile/grid object the unit is on
- - - select multiple units:
- - - - - - if multiple units are selected, get their available grid positions they can each move to
- - - - - - check what movement grid positions the multiple units share, if any 
- - - - - - if there are shared movement grid positions, show those grid positions as possible "moves"
- Pathfinding to allow unit to move from one grid position to another
- Allow for obstacles/walls on the grid
- - - pathfinding to navigate around obstacles
- "Fog of war" on the grid - only reveal tiles within a certain range of player's units
- - - black for tiles that have not been navigated to or seen yet. Transparent grey for ones that have been but are no longer in view
- - - - - - "in view" modifiable by a "view distance" for each unit?
